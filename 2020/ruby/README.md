# Advent of Code 2020

Advent of Code 2020 solutions in Ruby.

## Requirements

- I'm using Ruby 2.7, but so far any recent version should work.
- `rspec` for tests - run `bundle install` to get it set up.

## Running

Generally, just run `dayN/solution.rb dayN/input.txt` to run that day's solution. I usually leave the solution set for part 2 of any given day, but the code for part 1 will be commented out.

Last year I started organizing things into classes and libraries rather than one-off scripts, and I'm continuing that this year.

## Tests

`bundle exec rspec` will run the test suite.
