# Advent of Code 2021

Advent of Code 2021 solutions in Ruby

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.0.2 (but older versions may work).

## Running

You can run any given day like so:

```sh
# From the root of the repository
$ cd ./2021/day1
$ ./part1
```

My own puzzle input is stored alongside the solutions. The scripts all accept a filename as an argument, so you can use your own input (or, perhaps, the sample input given with the puzzle description):

```sh
$ cd ./2021/day1
$ ./part1 path/to/some/input_file
```

## Tests
